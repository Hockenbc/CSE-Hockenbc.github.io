        <h1>Bats aren't what they seem!</h1>
        <h2>Did you know Bats are the fastest flying mammal?</h2>
        <p>According to the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/549644-fastest-bat"> Gunness World Records</a> , 
       the Brazillion Free-Tailed Bat is the fastes flying mammal in the world! Just behind the fasted flying bird, this bat has a top record
       speed of 108 mph.  The Brazillion Free-Tailed bat suprisingly is faster than the White Throated Needle Tailed Bird, which 
    has a top record speed of 106 mph! Even though the fastest flying bird, the peregrine falcon, can fly up to 200 mph while diving, this bat makes up with
    natural speed and agility.</p>

    <h2>Differences between Microbats and Megabats</h2>
    <p>Believe it or not, microbats and megabats aren't different just in size, but in many things such as their diet and hunting styles.
        For example, microbats have ears relative to their body size and are smaller in size. On the other hands megabats have ears 
        smaller than their relative body size and are larger, some wingspands reaching 6ft in size! 
        Have you ever heard the myth that bats are <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/faqs/are-bats-blind"> blind</a> ? Microbats use echolocation to hunt for food 
        and suprisingly, megabats just use their sight.
